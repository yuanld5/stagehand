## What is `extract()`?

```typescript
page.extract("extract the name of the repository");
```

`extract` grabs structured data from a webpage. You can define your schema with [zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod) (TypeScript) or [pydantic](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic) (Python). If you do not want to define a schema, you can also call `extract` with just a [natural language prompt](#extract-with-just-a-prompt), or call `extract` [with no parameters](#extract-with-no-parameters).

<Note>
For TypeScript, the extract schemas are defined using zod schemas.

For Python, the extract schemas are defined using pydantic models.

## Using `extract()`

### Single object Extraction

Here is how an `extract` call might look for a single object:

<CodeGroup>
```typescript TypeScript
const item = await page.extract({
  instruction: "extract the price of the item",
  schema: z.object({
    price: z.number(),
  }),
});
```

```python Python
class Extraction(BaseModel):
    price: float

item = await page.extract(
    "extract the price of the item", 
    schema=Extraction
)
```
</CodeGroup>

Your output schema will look like:
```Example
{ price: number }
```

### List of objects Extraction

Here is how an `extract` call might look for a list of objects.

<CodeGroup>
```typescript TypeScript
const apartments = await page.extract({
  instruction:
    "Extract ALL the apartment listings and their details, including address, price, and square feet.",
  schema: z.object({
    list_of_apartments: z.array(
      z.object({
        address: z.string(),
        price: z.string(),
        square_feet: z.string(),
      }),
    ),
  })
})

console.log("the apartment list is: ", apartments);
```

```python Python
class Apartment(BaseModel):
    address: str
    price: str
    square_feet: str

class Apartments(BaseModel):
    list_of_apartments: list[Apartment]

apartments = await page.extract(
    "Extract ALL the apartment listings and their details as a list, including address, price, and square feet for each apartment",
    schema=Apartments
)

print("the apartment list is: ", apartments)
```
</CodeGroup>

Your output schema will look like:
```Example
list_of_apartments: [
    {
      address: "street address here",
      price: "$1234.00",
      square_feet: "700"
    },
    {
        address: "another address here",
        price: "1010.00",
        square_feet: "500"
    },
    ...
]
```

### Prompt-only Extraction

You can call `extract` with just a natural language prompt:

<CodeGroup>
```typescript TypeScript
const result = await page.extract("extract the name of the repository");
```

```python Python
result = await page.extract("extract the name of the repository")
```
</CodeGroup>

When you call `extract` with just a prompt, your output schema will look like:
```Example
{ extraction: string }
```

### Extract with no parameters

Here is how you can call `extract` with no parameters.

<CodeGroup>
```typescript TypeScript
const pageText = await page.extract();
```

```python Python
page_text = await page.extract()
```
</CodeGroup>

Output schema:
```Example
{ page_text: string }
```

Calling `extract` with no parameters will return hierarchical tree representation of the root DOM. This will not be passed through an LLM. It will look something like this:

```
Accessibility Tree:
[0-2] RootWebArea: What is Stagehand? - 🤘 Stagehand
  [0-37] scrollable
    [0-118] body
      [0-241] scrollable
        [0-242] div
          [0-244] link: 🤘 Stagehand home page light logo
            [0-245] span
              [0-246] StaticText: 🤘 Stagehand
              [0-247] StaticText: home page
```

## Best practices


### Extract with Context

You can provide additional context to your schema to help the model extract the data more accurately.

<CodeGroup>
```typescript TypeScript
const apartments = await page.extract({
 instruction:
   "Extract ALL the apartment listings and their details, including address, price, and square feet.",
 schema: z.object({
   list_of_apartments: z.array(
     z.object({
       address: z.string().describe("the address of the apartment"),
       price: z.string().describe("the price of the apartment"),
       square_feet: z.string().describe("the square footage of the apartment"),
     }),
   ),
 })
})
```

```python Python
class Apartment(BaseModel):
    address: str = Field(..., description="the address of the apartment")
    price: str = Field(..., description="the price of the apartment")
    square_feet: str = Field(..., description="the square footage of the apartment")

class Apartments(BaseModel):
    list_of_apartments: list[Apartment]

apartments = await page.extract(
    "Extract ALL the apartment listings and their details as a list. For each apartment, include: the address of the apartment, the price of the apartment, and the square footage of the apartment",
    schema=Apartments
)
```
</CodeGroup>

### Link Extraction
<Note>
To extract links or URLs, in the TypeScript version of Stagehand, you'll need to define the relevant field as `z.string().url()`.
In Python, you'll need to define it as `HttpUrl`.
</Note>

Here is how an `extract` call might look for extracting a link or URL. This also works for image links.

<CodeGroup>
```typescript TypeScript
const extraction = await page.extract({
  instruction: "extract the link to the 'contact us' page",
  schema: z.object({
    link: z.string().url(), // note the usage of z.string().url() here
  }),
});

console.log("the link to the contact us page is: ", extraction.link);
```

```python Python
class Extraction(BaseModel):
    link: HttpUrl # note the usage of HttpUrl here

extraction = await page.extract(
    "extract the link to the 'contact us' page", 
    schema=Extraction
)

print("the link to the contact us page is: ", extraction.link)
```
</CodeGroup>

<Tip>
Inside Stagehand, extracting links works by asking the LLM to select an ID. Stagehand looks up that ID in a mapping of IDs -> URLs. When logging the LLM trace, you should expect to see IDs. The actual URLs will be included in the final `ExtractResult`.
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Empty or partial results">
**Problem**: `extract()` returns empty or incomplete data

**Solutions**:
- **Check your instruction clarity**: Make sure your instruction is specific and describes exactly what data you want to extract
- **Verify the data exists**: Use `page.observe()` first to confirm the data is present on the page
- **Wait for dynamic content**: If the page loads content dynamically, use `page.act("wait for the content to load")` before extracting

**Solution: Wait for content before extracting**
<CodeGroup>
```typescript TypeScript
// Wait for content before extracting
await page.act("wait for the product listings to load");
const products = await page.extract({
  instruction: "extract all product names and prices",
  schema: z.object({
    products: z.array(z.object({
      name: z.string(),
      price: z.string()
    }))
  })
});
```

```python Python
# Wait for content before extracting
await page.act("wait for the product listings to load")
products = await page.extract(
    "extract all product names and prices",
    schema=ProductList
)
```
</CodeGroup>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Schema validation errors">
**Problem**: Getting schema validation errors or type mismatches

**Solutions**:
- **Use optional fields**: Make fields optional with `z.optional()` (TypeScript) or `Optional[type]` (Python) if the data might not always be present
- **Use flexible types**: Consider using `z.string()` instead of `z.number()` for prices that might include currency symbols
- **Add descriptions**: Use `.describe()` (TypeScript) or `Field(description="...")` (Python) to help the model understand field requirements

**Solution: More flexible schema**
<CodeGroup>
```typescript TypeScript
const schema = z.object({
  price: z.string().describe("price including currency symbol, e.g., '$19.99'"),
  availability: z.string().optional().describe("stock status if available"),
  rating: z.number().optional()
});
```

```python Python
class FlexibleProduct(BaseModel):
    price: str = Field(description="price including currency symbol, e.g., '$19.99'")
    availability: Optional[str] = Field(default=None, description="stock status if available")
    rating: Optional[float] = None
```
</CodeGroup>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Inconsistent results">
**Problem**: Extraction results vary between runs

**Solutions**:
- **Be more specific in instructions**: Instead of "extract prices", use "extract the numerical price value for each item"
- **Use context in schema descriptions**: Add field descriptions to guide the model
- **Combine with observe**: Use `page.observe()` to understand the page structure first

**Solution: Validate with observe first**
<CodeGroup>
```typescript TypeScript
// First observe to understand the page structure
const elements = await page.observe("find all product listings");
console.log("Found elements:", elements.map(e => e.description));

// Then extract with specific targeting
const products = await page.extract({
  instruction: "extract name and price from each product listing shown on the page",
  schema: z.object({
    products: z.array(z.object({
      name: z.string().describe("the product title or name"),
      price: z.string().describe("the price as displayed, including currency")
    }))
  })
});
```

```python Python
# First observe to understand the page structure
elements = await page.observe("find all product listings")
print("Found elements:", [e.description for e in elements])

# Then extract with specific targeting
products = await page.extract(
    "extract name and price from each product listing shown on the page",
    schema=ProductSchema
)
```
</CodeGroup>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Performance issues">
**Problem**: Extraction is slow or timing out

**Solutions**:
- **Reduce scope**: Extract smaller chunks of data in multiple calls rather than everything at once
- **Use targeted instructions**: Be specific about which part of the page to focus on
- **Consider pagination**: For large datasets, extract one page at a time
- **Increase timeout**: Use `timeoutMs` parameter for complex extractions

**Solution: Break down large extractions**
<CodeGroup>
```typescript TypeScript
// Instead of extracting everything at once
const allData = [];
const pageNumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

for (const pageNum of pageNumbers) {
  await page.act(`navigate to page ${pageNum}`);
  
  const pageData = await page.extract({
    instruction: "extract product data from the current page only",
    schema: ProductPageSchema,
    timeoutMs: 60000 // 60 second timeout
  });
  
  allData.push(...pageData.products);
}
```

```python Python
# Instead of extracting everything at once
all_data = []
page_numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

for page_num in page_numbers:
    await page.act(f"navigate to page {page_num}")
    
    page_data = await page.extract(
        "extract product data from the current page only",
        schema=ProductPageSchema,
        timeout_ms=60000  # 60 second timeout
    )
    
    all_data.extend(page_data.products)
```
